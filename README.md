# Story about this project
My teachers never realised the capabilities of our school managment software, so they decided to configure the permission so badly that i couldnt even see the homework let alone managing it. So as always when something i use on a daily basis and i can optimize it i decided to create a version myself that fetches the data from untis and also uses my database so i can create e.g. reminders by myself. Short form: i thought i can do better
